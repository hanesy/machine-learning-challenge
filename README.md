# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. 

<b> This project creates a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset. </b>

## Getting Started

The final model is HERE.
The other models are in its own notebook.

### Prerequisites

Which libraries did I use?
Make sure the packages are up to date by running the pip install cells in the jupyter notebook.

## Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).

Summary table here?

### Section for each model.
